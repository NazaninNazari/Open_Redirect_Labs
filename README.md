## 🧠 What is Open Redirect?
An Open Redirect vulnerability occurs when an application allows an attacker to influence the destination of a redirect without properly validating the destination.
A simplified example is:
    https://example.com/redirect?url=https://example.org

If the application takes the `url` parameter and redirects the browser to that value without appropriate validation, the destination may be controlled by the user.
The vulnerability is not simply about redirecting a user.

The important security issue is:
    Untrusted Input
          ↓
    Redirect Destination
          ↓
    Browser Navigation

Understanding where the redirect destination comes from, how it is processed, and whether it is properly validated is the core of Open Redirect analysis.

---

## 🔬 Investigation Methodology
When investigating an Open Redirect vulnerability, follow the redirect destination from its source to the browser.
A typical flow looks like:
    User Input
        ↓
    URL Parameter
        ↓
    Application Variable
        ↓
    URL Processing
        ↓
    Validation
        ↓
    Redirect Function
        ↓
    HTTP Response / JavaScript
        ↓
    Browser Navigation
        ↓
    Destination

During your investigation, ask:

### 1. Where does the destination come from?
Look for user-controlled values such as:
    url
    next
    redirect
    redirect_url
    return
    return_url
    destination
    target

---

### 2. Can the user control the value?
Determine whether the redirect destination comes directly or indirectly from:
    Query Parameters
    Form Parameters
    Cookies
    Headers
    Client-Side Storage
    JavaScript Variables
    Authentication Parameters

---

### 3. How is the redirect performed?
Look for server-side mechanisms such as:
    Flask redirect()
    HTTP 301
    HTTP 302
    HTTP 303
    HTTP 307
    HTTP 308

Or client-side mechanisms such as:
    window.location
    location.href
    location.assign()
    location.replace()

---

### 4. Is the destination validated?
Check whether the application validates:
    Scheme
    Hostname
    Origin
    Port
    Path
    Destination

---

### 5. How is the URL parsed?
Determine whether the application correctly understands the structure of the URL.
A URL can contain multiple components:
    scheme://hostname:port/path?query#fragment

Incorrect parsing or incomplete validation can result in unexpected behavior.

---

### 6. Is there an allowlist?
An application may allow only trusted destinations.
For example:
    example.com
    trusted.example.com

The important question is whether the validation actually verifies the intended component of the URL.

---

### 7. Is there a blocklist?
Some applications attempt to block known dangerous destinations.
Blocklists can be difficult to maintain because URL syntax has many valid representations.
The Labs demonstrate different validation patterns so you can understand why URL validation must be designed carefully.

---

## 🌐 URL Concepts
Understanding Open Redirect requires a solid understanding of URLs.
Important concepts include:

### Scheme
Examples:
    http:
    https:

---

### Hostname
Example:
    example.com

---

### Port
Example:
    example.com:8080

---

### Path
Example:
    /login

---

### Query
Example:
    ?next=/dashboard

---

### Fragment
Example:
    #section

---

### Absolute URL
Example:
    https://example.com/login

---

### Relative URL
Example:
    /login

---

### Scheme-relative URL
Example:
    //example.com/login

Understanding these components is important when analyzing redirect validation.

---

## 🧩 Redirect Mechanisms
Open Redirect vulnerabilities can appear in different parts of an application.

### Server-Side Redirects
The server determines the destination and sends a redirect response to the browser.
Typical flow:
    Browser
       ↓
    Server
       ↓
    HTTP 3xx
       ↓
    Location Header
       ↓
    Browser
       ↓
    Destination

---

### Client-Side Redirects
JavaScript determines the destination.
Common APIs include:
    window.location
    location.href
    location.assign()
    location.replace()

Typical flow:
    User Input
        ↓
    JavaScript
        ↓
    Location API
        ↓
    Browser
        ↓
    Destination

---

## 🧪 URL Validation
One of the most important concepts in this project is URL validation.
A secure application should not blindly trust a redirect destination supplied by the user.

Depending on the application's requirements, validation may involve:
- Allowlisting trusted destinations.
- Restricting redirects to relative paths.
- Validating the URL scheme.
- Parsing the URL before validation.
- Validating the hostname.
- Validating the origin.
- Rejecting unexpected external destinations.
- Avoiding weak string comparisons.
- Avoiding incomplete blocklists.

The correct validation strategy depends on the application's intended redirect behavior.

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation
Common defensive strategies include:

### Prefer Relative Paths
If the application only needs to redirect users inside the same application, relative paths can reduce unnecessary exposure to external destinations.
Example:
    /dashboard

instead of accepting arbitrary absolute URLs.

---

### Use an Allowlist
If external redirects are required, explicitly define trusted destinations.
For example:
    https://trusted.example.com

Only destinations that satisfy the application's requirements should be accepted.

---

### Parse URLs Correctly
Do not rely solely on simple string operations when validating URLs.
Parse the URL and validate the components that actually matter to the application's security policy.

---

### Validate the Scheme
If only secure web URLs are expected, restrict accepted schemes appropriately.
For example:
    https:

---

### Validate the Hostname
If redirects are intended only for trusted domains, validate the parsed hostname according to the application's actual trust boundary.

---

### Avoid Weak String Checks
Checks such as:
    url.startswith("https://trusted.example.com")

may not be sufficient as a complete URL security policy.
The entire URL structure and relevant components should be considered.

---

## ⚠️ Security Impact
Open Redirect vulnerabilities can have security consequences depending on where and how the redirect is used.
Potential impact can include:
- Phishing assistance
- Social engineering
- Abuse of trusted links
- Misleading authentication flows
- Redirect manipulation
- Abuse of login or logout flows
- Increased credibility of malicious links
- Interaction with other application vulnerabilities

The actual impact depends on the application, the redirect location, and the surrounding security controls.

---

## 🔗 Open Redirect and Authentication
Redirect parameters frequently appear in authentication-related functionality.
Examples include:
    /login?next=/dashboard

or:
    /logout?redirect=/home

Redirect functionality can also appear in:
- Login flows
- Logout flows
- Password reset flows
- Account recovery flows
- OAuth-style flows
- Single Sign-On flows

These situations require additional care because redirect behavior can become part of a security-sensitive workflow.

---

## 🧠 Source-to-Sink Thinking
A key goal of this project is learning to think in terms of:
    Source → Data Flow → Validation → Sink → Browser → Impact

For Open Redirect:
    Source
      ↓
    User-Controlled URL
      ↓
    Data Flow
      ↓
    URL Parsing / Validation
      ↓
    Redirect Sink
      ↓
    Browser Navigation
      ↓
    External Destination

This methodology is more important than memorizing individual payloads or bypass techniques.

## 🧪 Lab Philosophy
These Labs are intentionally vulnerable.
The purpose is not simply to find a working redirect.
The purpose is to understand:
    Why is the input controllable?
    How does the input reach the redirect?
    How is the URL interpreted?
    What validation exists?
    Is the validation sufficient?
    What is the security impact?
    How should the vulnerability be fixed?

Understanding the reasoning behind the vulnerability is more important than memorizing a specific technique.

---

## 🔐 Safe Testing
All Labs are designed to run in a controlled local environment.
Use the Labs to practice:
- Source-code analysis
- Manual testing
- URL analysis
- Browser debugging
- HTTP inspection
- Vulnerability identification
- Secure coding
- Mitigation techniques

Only test Open Redirect vulnerabilities against systems that you own or have explicit authorization to assess.

---

## ⚠️ Rules
- Run the Labs locally.
- Do not test against websites you do not own.
- Do not use these Labs to conduct unauthorized attacks.
- Use only controlled environments for experimentation.
- Use harmless destinations during testing.
- Focus on understanding the vulnerability and its mitigation.
- Obtain permission before performing security testing against any external system.

## 🎓 What This Project Teaches
The most important lesson of this project is learning how to reason about user-controlled URLs.
A vulnerability is not simply:
    "The application redirects."

Instead, investigate:

    Where does the destination come from?
             ↓
    Can the user control it?
             ↓
    How is it processed?
             ↓
    Is it parsed correctly?
             ↓
    Is it validated?
             ↓
    Where is it sent?
             ↓
    How does the browser interpret it?
             ↓
    What security impact can result?

This way of thinking can be applied to real-world security testing and secure application development.
